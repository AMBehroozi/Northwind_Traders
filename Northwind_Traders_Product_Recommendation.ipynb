    "* Each row represents an **order (basket)**.\n",
    "* Each column represents a **product**.\n",
    "* The Apriori algorithm finds **frequent item combinations** (e.g., products bought together).\n",
    "* The `association_rules` function derives rules like:\n",
    "  ‚ÄúIf Product A is bought, Product B is also likely.‚Äù\n",

    "* Products often bought together likely serve complementary needs (e.g., coffee + sugar).\n",
